<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Sarah. I'm originally from New Jersey and currently reside in Las Vegas, Nevada. I've recently started my journey into the web development and design world. I've always been interested in design and putting my visualizations into reality, but I also love looking at the logistic side of things, and after researching web development it was something I discovered I wanted to pursue.</p>

<p>What I lack in current web dev experience I make up for with my passion to persevere, and I'm looking forward to building my new career.</p>
