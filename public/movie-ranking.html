<h1>The Best Movies According to Sarah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Disney movie. I particularly love the scene in the field of dandelions.</p>

<h3>Clue</h3>
<p>A great take on the classic board game. It brings comedy and suspense while staying true to the nature of my favorite board game.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<p>The movie that first transported me to this magical world, and allowed me to discover my love of all things Harry Potter.</p>
